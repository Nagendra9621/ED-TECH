🎯 Face Recognition Attendance System

A Machine Learning–based Attendance System that uses Face Recognition to automatically mark attendance.
It uses OpenCV for face detection, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for face classification, and stores attendance logs in CSV files.

🚀 Features

✅ Detects and recognizes faces in real time using webcam
✅ Marks attendance automatically with timestamp
✅ Uses KNN algorithm for recognition
✅ Stores attendance in date-wise CSV files
✅ Simple voice feedback (“Attendance Taken”) using Windows SAPI
✅ Modular code — includes separate scripts for training (add_face.py) and testing (test.py)
✅ Lightweight — runs on any system with Python and OpenCV


🧠 Technologies Used


Python 3.10+


OpenCV – Face detection


Scikit-learn – KNN model


NumPy – Data handling


pywin32 – Text-to-speech feedback


CSV – Attendance storage



🎨 Future Enhancements
🔹 Replace KNN with deep learning models (e.g., FaceNet or Dlib)
🔹 Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
🔹 Cloud storage for attendance logs
🔹 Multi-camera support
